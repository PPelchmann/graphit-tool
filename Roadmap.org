* Ideas/Roadmap
  - All Graph-native objects have a .data, .json, .yaml and .xml
    method that exposes the data in the respective format
  - Expose Timeseries as pandas dataframe for easy plotting
  - Queries should return Objects of the respective Classes instead of
    raw lists of dicts.
  - Timeseries and Attachments should check ogit/_type
  - Logging instead of writing to sys.stderr
  - Re–implement queries
  - Rework Exception hierachy
  - Turn the module into a package under the "arago" namespace
  - The return of the actual "graphit-tool" command–line tool
  - Integrate the "helper" module
  - Integrate the "connect" module
  - New classes for the specialized APIs
  - Integrate with ipython for a "graphit-shell"
  - Long-term: Jupyter-only: Graph visualizations???
  - Long-term: Expose subgraphs as networkx graphs, with two-way sync
  - Long-term: Expose subgraphs in a standard, serialized format
  - Long-term: Provide import methods for all of the above
